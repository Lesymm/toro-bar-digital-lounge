              Welcome to Toro Bar, Washington, D.C.'s home for great drinks, good vibes, and billiards. 
              Nestled in the heart of Columbia Heights, Toro Bar isn't just a bar â€” it's a community hub. 
              With a full bar, pool tables, hookah, and a calendar packed with events, we bring people 
              together for nights full of connection, laughter, and friendly competition.

              Founded in 2020 during the height of COVID by a D.C. native who grew up right here in the 
              neighborhood, Toro Bar was built with one purpose in mind: to create a space where the 
              community could come together. What started as a vision during uncertain times has grown 
              into a vibrant gathering place, a spot where locals, friends, and visitors all feel at home.
            </p>

              Whether you're here to shoot pool, sip cocktails, dance to DJs, or just unwind with friends, 
              Toro Bar is where D.C. comes to play. From the first break to the last call, the energy at 
              Toro is unmatched!
